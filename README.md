📄  PDF Generation API (.NET)

This project demonstrates a real-world backend API built with ASP.NET Core that generates PDF documents from structured input data.

The API accepts JSON payloads and generates PDFs such as reports, invoices, or summaries using iTextSharp, with support for reusable layouts, tables, headers, and footers.

This project reflects production-style backend work, focusing on clean architecture, maintainability, and API-first design.
